  "description": "DataGrid can display a popup edit form. The form can include any fields from the bound data source, regardless of whether the corresponding column is visible in the grid (see the Notes and Address columns).\nTo enable this behavior in your application, do the following:\n\nSet editing.mode to \"popup\".\nSet the editing object's allowUpdating, allowAdding, and allowDeleting properties to true.\n\nDataGrid uses the DevExtreme Form and Popup components to display the form and the popup. Their default configurations are defined automatically. If these configurations do not meet your requirements, you can redefine them in the editing object's form and popup properties as shown in this demo. For more information about this edit mode's limitations, refer to the descriptions of these properties.\n",
